Problem Statement:

IT jobs and technologies keep evolving quickly. This makes our field to be one of the
most interesting out there. But on the other hand, such fast development confuses our
students. They do not know which skills they need to learn for which job.

“Do | need to learn C++ to be a Data Scientist?” “Do DevOps and System admins use
the same technologies?” “I really like JavaScript; can | use it in Data Analytics?”
Those are some of the questions that our students ask.


Could you please develop a data-driven solution for our students to answer such
questions? They mostly want to understand the relationships between the jobs and
the technologies.
